This is a choose your own adventure game set in an enchanted forest.

Current bug: Text changes whether you've been to the current page, not the extension pages. You can visit one branch of a node, return to the parent of the branch, and get spoilers about another node.

I've started the process of fixing this, but the code no longer works while i'm fixing it.
